# Session 1: Introduction to Move and Aptos Sample 

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand what the Move language is and why it was created
- Explore the Aptos blockchain and its architecture
- Set up your development environment
- Write your first Move module

## 📖 Lesson Overview

Move is a safe and flexible language for smart contract development, originally developed for the Diem blockchain. It is now used in the Aptos and Sui ecosystems. In this session, we'll dive into:

- What is Move?
- Comparison with Solidity and Rust
- Installing Move CLI and Aptos CLI
- Writing and compiling your first `HelloBlockchain.move` module

## 💻 Hands-On Task

Inside the `code/` directory:
- `hello_blockchain.move` — a simple smart contract to deploy
- `Move.toml` and `Sources/` — project structure

## 📚 Further Reading

See `reading.md` in this folder for links to official Move documentation, Aptos guides, and community tutorials.
